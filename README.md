# Russian Roulette

Pretty solid WIP project on the famous game Russian Roulette, this is a mutliplayer lobby based game with 5 players in each lobby. Skins are not customizable at the moment and 
all I can say is that this Unity project is a very heavy project so, I might consider putting it up at https://www.itch.io if possible when completed. It implements shaders,
post-processing, lobby managing, game managing and simulation based controlling systems.

Anyways, when it is done I will post it on itch.io and up until then, yall can enjoy the logic and can also take up your own project from this!

Cheers, fellow coders!
